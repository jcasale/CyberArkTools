### OS Username (--username)
The name of the user who can use this file. Typically specified in "domain\username" format. Example: SYSTEM -> "nt authority\system". This will normally also be a specific user created in the vault for initial setup purposes. In some cases, this user can be cyberark specific and will not exist on the Active Directory domain.

### Executable Path (--exepath)
Full path to the executable that is using the file.

### Machine IP (--machineip)
IP of the machine the .cred file is used on. In most cases this will be the local machine the file was found on, but CAN be a remote system.

### Machine Hostname (--hostname)
Hostname of the system the .cred file is used on. FQDN not required. In most cases this will be the local machine the file was found on, but CAN be a remote system.
